### Ramblings on WebDev in 2024

**My final opinion on this tech stack:**
- it is good, for javascript. nextauth is awesome. server side rendering is sweet. nextjs app handlers/routers are great, can't see the benefit of the pages stuff they were doing in the old versions. 
- It is not good enough to convert me to a ver-cel lol


my really slow VPS can't handle nextjs so I likely will never finish this little project.
I'm going back to writing webpages in C like god intended.

I am coming to the conclusion that the talent in webdev is created by applied gatekeeping at scale. 
A twitter clone should not be harder than writing an OS, but because it is so abstracted and inconsistently documented, with API breaking changes in weird ways along the way, it becomes more difficult in a different way.
So easy to take a piece of paper and draft up how a website full-stack should function, so hard to take a piece of paper and do the same for an operating system. The OS is easier to implement x1000 (except ACPI that is WebDev at heart)

Is nextjs supposed to be the new standard for writing webapps in 2024? It has broken tooling all over and the 'client' 'server' directives are shoddy

I can see what they're trying to do, and feel like the design pattern they talk about in the docs is adjacent to just writing "go-like" backend code 

Maybe I need to try that Golang SSR/components library and just suck it up.

I don't want to use typescript but I want to declare types LOL, like just JS with structs 
I take it back I just looked into that and the more I learn about JS weird little things the more scared I get. In an existential way not of the language. 
Maybe I do want to use typescript lmao
