# Quick unfinished twitter clone to see what nextjs is all about
verdict: it is good, for javascript. nextauth is awesome. server side rendering is sweet. nextjs app handlers/routers are great, can't see the benefit of the pages stuff they were doing in the old versions. It is not good enough to convert me to a ver-cell lol


my really slow VPS can't handle nextjs so I likely will never finish this.
I'm going back to writing webpages in C like god intended.
